    <h2>Hey Explorers</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my sketch showcase where my skills meet precision.
      <br><br>
      This website is a quiet collection of hand-drawn sketches, created with patience and intent.
      Each piece is the result of careful observation — moments slowed down and translated onto paper.
      <br><br>
      Along with sketches, you’ll also find some photography — simple captures taken on my phone,
      valued more for interest than perfection.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I’m Yugraj — a small artist who sketches in free time to express emotions,
      creativity, and to refresh the mind.
      <br><br>
      I sketch to understand form, light, and emotion rather than to perfect them.
      Most of my work begins without a fixed outcome, allowing the drawing to evolve
      naturally through the process.

          <h3>Beauty on the Nose</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            This sketch captures a moment suspended between instinct and quiet wonder. The cat’s gaze is drawn toward the light, attentive yet unguarded, as though curiosity has momentarily softened caution. 
            The presence of the butterfly resting upon the nose feels weightless, not as an interruption but as a meeting—an unplanned pause where two lives briefly acknowledge one another. 
            Rather than reacting, the cat remains still, suggesting a rare trust formed in silence rather than motion.
          </p>
          <br>  
          <br>
          <p>
            Light moves gently across the form, shaping texture and shadow without urgency. The lines remain imperfect and open, allowing the drawing to breathe and the moment to remain unresolved. Nothing here demands attention; instead, the sketch invites patience, asking the viewer to observe slowly. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In this fragile balance between alertness and calm, the work reflects how beauty often reveals itself in fleeting encounters—moments that cannot be held, only noticed. What endures is not the event itself, but the awareness it creates, reminding us that gentleness is strongest when it is unforced.

          <h3>A Life in Quiet Chords</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
           This sketch captures a moment where time seems to rest rather than move. The figure sits grounded, absorbed in the quiet dialogue between hand and instrument, suggesting that music here is not a performance but a necessity. 
           His posture is heavy with experience, yet gentle in intent, as if every note carries memories shaped by years rather than moments. 
           The roughness of the lines mirrors the weight of life lived fully—creases, folds, and shadows are not softened, but accepted.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
           The guitar becomes more than an object; it is a companion, worn and familiar, shaped by repetition and patience. 
           There is no audience present, and perhaps none required. What unfolds is an inward act—sound imagined rather than heard, emotion felt rather than displayed. 
           The stillness surrounding the figure amplifies this solitude, reminding us that creation often happens away from recognition.
           In this quiet exchange between silence and sound, the sketch reflects how art, much like life, finds its meaning not in perfection, but in persistence.

          <h3>A Pause in the Wild</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
           This sketch captures a fragile balance between instinct and gentleness. The squirrel sits alert yet composed, holding a small twig as if it were something earned rather than taken. 
          </p><br>
          <p>
          Light falls softly across its form, emphasizing not only texture but awareness—the quiet intelligence present in small lives often overlooked. Perched on the edge of the tree stump, the figure feels suspended between safety and exposure, reminding us how survival is shaped by attentiveness rather than force. 
          The roughness of the stump contrasts with the softness of fur, suggesting that resilience and delicacy often coexist. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
           In this moment of stillness, the sketch reflects how nature carries its own form of patience, where even the smallest beings move with purpose, caution, and quiet grace.

          <h3>Stillness Before the Strike</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
This sketch portrays a solitary figure caught between motion and restraint, moving forward without urgency yet without hesitation.<br><br>
The face remains hidden beneath the conical hat, shifting focus away from identity and toward intent. What defines the figure is not who he is, but the discipline he carries — reflected in posture, balance, and the quiet readiness of the sword at his side.<br><br>
The long shadow stretching across the ground suggests a past that follows closely, shaped by experience rather than regret. Lines are sharp and deliberate, allowing stillness to coexist with latent movement. In this moment, the sketch reflects control over impulse — a calm acceptance that strength does not always announce itself, but waits patiently, prepared.
